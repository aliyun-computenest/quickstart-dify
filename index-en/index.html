<h2> Overview </h2>

<p>Dify.AI is an LLMOps platform that helps developers build AI applications easier and faster. Its core idea is to define all aspects of an AI application through declarable YAML files, including prompts, contexts, and plug-ins. Dify provides functions such as visual Prompt orchestration, operation, and data set management. These capabilities enable developers to complete the development of AI applications in days, or quickly integrate LLM into existing applications, and continue to operate and improve to create a truly valuable AI application.
This method provides a solution for deploying a stand-alone version of Dify, and quickly deploys Dify through Docker Compose. This deployment method does not have high availability and scalability characteristics, is not suitable for use in a production environment, and is recommend used for development testing. </p>
